        <p>A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling. Fans are used to
            draw cooler air into the case from the outside, expel warm air from inside and move air across a heat sink
            to cool a particular component. Both axial and sometimes centrifugal (blower/squirrel-cage) fans are used in
            computers. Computer fans commonly come in standard sizes, such as 120 mm (most common), 140 mm, 240 mm, and
            even 360 mm. And are also all powered and controlled using 3-pin or 4-pin fan connectors. <br> <br> Fans are
            used to move air through the computer case. The components inside the case cannot dissipate heat efficiently
            if the surrounding air is too hot. Case fans may be placed as intake fans, drawing cooler outside air in
            through the front or bottom of the chassis (where it may also be drawn over the internal hard drive racks),
            or exhaust fans, expelling warm air through the top or rear. Some ATX tower cases have one or more
            additional vents and mounting points in the left side panel where one or more fans may be installed to blow
            cool air directly onto the motherboard components and expansion cards, which are among the largest heat
            sources.
            <br> <br>
            Standard axial case fans are 40, 60, 80, 92, 120, 140, 200 and 220 mm in width and length. As case fans are
            often the most readily visible form of cooling on a PC, decorative fans are widely available and may be lit
            with LEDs, made of UV-reactive plastic, and/or covered with decorative grilles. Decorative fans and
            accessories are popular with case modders. Air filters are often used over intake fans, to prevent dust from
            entering the case and clogging up the internal components. Heatsinks are especially vulnerable to being
            clogged up, as the insulating effect of the dust will rapidly degrade the heatsink's ability to dissipate
            heat. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fan">More info.</a>

        <h3>Cases</h3>

        <p>Here at Galway Computer Co we have a wide range of case options for everyone to choose from. No matter what
            form factor you want we have it all, from custom liquid cooling solutions to small compact micro ATX builds.
            We will have a case right for you.
            <br> <br>
            Cases can come in many different sizes (known as form factors). The size and shape of a computer case are
            usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard since it is the largest component of most
            computers. Cases are also referred to by their size (such as ATX case, Mini ITX case, etc.) Consequently,
            personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case. Form
            factors for rack-mounted and blade servers may include precise external dimensions as well since these cases
            must themselves fit in specific enclosures.
            <br> <br>
            For example, a case designed for an ATX motherboard and power supply may take on several external forms such
            as a vertical tower (designed to sit on the floor, height > width), a flat desktop (height < width) or pizza
                box (height ≤ 5 cm (2 in) designed to sit on the desk under the computer's monitor). Full-size tower
                cases are typically larger in volume than desktop cases, with more room for drive bays, expansion slots,
                and custom or all-in-one (AIO) water cooling solutions. Desktop cases—and mini-tower cases under about
                46 cm (18 in) high—are popular in business environments where space is at a premium.[1] Currently, the
                most popular form factor for desktop computers is ATX,[citation needed] although microATX and small form
                factors have also become very popular for a variety of uses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case">More info.</a>
